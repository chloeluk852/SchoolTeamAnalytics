# The Preface School Team Analytics 2025  
The dashboard provides a comprehensive look at the organization's educational impact. 

## Here is a summary of the key findings:

* **Executive Impact:** The team successfully delivered **107 sessions** to **2,120 participants**, maintaining a strong weighted satisfaction score of **4.426/5**.
* **Quality Benchmarks:** Both Content (**4.337**) and Instructor (**4.429**) scores are robust, though the dashboard highlights a significant need for practical application over theoretical lecturing.
* **Audience Insights:** Primary and University segments show the highest satisfaction levels (up to **4.90**), while the Teacher segment is more volatile, demanding high-utility tools that directly reduce their workload.
* **Operational Trends:** The curriculum is predominantly delivered in Cantonese (**63.6%**), with secondary students and teachers making up the bulk of the audience impact.
* **Instructor Performance:** There is a clear hierarchy of performance across segments, with instructors like Sean and Joey setting the benchmark for teacher training, while others like Cman excel in student-facing creative workshops.
* **Strategic Pivot for 2026:** The dashboard mandates a shift to the **"70/30 Rule"**—dedicating 70% of session time to hands-on practice—to address feedback regarding "listening fatigue" and to ensure students have enough time to finish their creative projects.
